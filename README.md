<h2>Open-Source :bulb:</h2>
I'm a fan of open-source, so I would like to keep this project available to those who are interested!  
  
You don't have to contact me regarding forking and using the code. However, I do not condone **plagiarism** :-1:, please give credit where credit is due.  
  
I _love_ the idea of giving back to the community, but coming across a website that has been copied without any indication of credit always gives off a really bad feeling. :pensive:

## Getting Started

To get started, ensure that `npm` v6+ is installed (NodeJS LTS comes with the latest version of `npm`). From there, you can run the following command in order to install all of the project dependencies:

`npm i`

It may be useful to install the Angular CLI globally. This can be done by executing the following command:

`npm i -g @angular/cli`

## Build :hammer:

Build the project using the Angular CLI. `ng build` The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running a Local Development Server

You may run an instance of the website through a local development server. Angular has a built-in command to serve the project on a local machine:

`ng serve --open`

If the default port `4200` does not work, use the `--port` flag and specify a port number for the local development server to run on.

`ng serve --port <port-number> --open`

After getting the development server up and running, the website can be accessed at:

`http://localhost:4200/`

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
