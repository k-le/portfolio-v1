      <h2>Infinite Campus (2021)</h2>

      <i>Blaine, MN</i>

      <p>
        After my first semester as a computer science student at the University
        of Minnesota, I wanted to look for an internship to gain valuable
        experience in the professional software development industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are <strong>two</strong> key aspects that I look for in any career
        and it's the opportunity to <i>give back</i> and to make a
        <i>positive</i> difference. I believe that one of the best ways to
        change the world is by getting directly involved with education and
        Infinite Campus provides technological solutions for school districts
        across the entire US.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Infinite Campus, I develop and work with <strong>RESTful</strong> web
        services in <strong style="color: #e76f00">Java</strong> and carry out
        front-end development in
        <strong style="color: var(--dark-red)">Angular</strong>. We use the
        <strong>Agile Scrum</strong> framework as a guideline for our software
        development lifecycle and
        <strong style="color: #0052cc">Atlassian Jira</strong> for handling bug
        and maintenance cases.

      <h2>Saint Paul College (2020)</h2>
      <h5>STEM Academic Tutor</h5>
      <i>Saint Paul, MN</i>
      <p>
        Like many other college students, I wanted to have some money coming in
        to fulfill my desires of going out to eat, drinking a
        <i class="red">copious</i> amount of bubble tea, and buying clothes and
        tech gadgets, so I chose to do a work-study at my community college.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working as a tutor was an
        <strong>invaluable</strong> experience. I was able to interact with so
        many students from different backgrounds and it taught me a lot about
        how different people learn and approach problems in their own, unique
        way.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time as a tutor at Saint Paul College, I had assisted over
        <i>250</i>
        students, providing one-on-one tutoring sessions covering a wide range
        of academic topics, such as physics, calculus, writing, and biology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also had the opportunity of training newly hired tutors on
        documentation routines, interacting with students, and how to layout a
        study session for efficiency and learning.
