      <h2>GitHub Issue Browser (2021)</h2>
      <p>
        What was initially a take-home coding assessment ended up being a
        personal project of mine. It had asked me to create a web application
        that would allow users to look up issues relating to a GitHub
        repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believed that the assessment provided a real-world problem and that a
        solution could be useful for real users, so I continued working on it
        after the deadline had passed. It was originally built using Python's
        <strong style="color: #144b37">Django</strong> web framework and
        utilized <strong>GitHub's API</strong> to fetch data.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had recently re-built the project using
        <strong style="color: var(--dark-red)">Angular 11</strong> and
        <strong style="color: var(--blue)">TypeScript</strong> with Angular
        Bootstrap components. The UI is cleaner, simpler, and provides a
        seamless experience for users.

        Ever since I was about 12 years old, I had a strong interest in
        <span style="color: green">personal finance</span>. I would ask my dad
        to be a personal bank and see if he could give interest on whatever I
        had given him to hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        The interest rate he had given me for holding on to my money was around
        10% and let me tell you, that rate <i>spoiled</i> me when I got older
        and realized that interest rates for savings accounts were no where near
        that.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interest in personal finance and has grown over the years and I
        wanted to take a shot at creating my own web application that allows
        users to track their spending.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the first web application that I had ever built and it was
        great fun! I learned a lot about <strong>HTML</strong>,
        <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>SQLite3</strong>, and the
        <strong style="color: #144b37">Django</strong> framework. I was able to
        implement a lot of features that I would have never imagined when I
        first started the project.

      <h2>Food Recipe Web Scraper (2020)</h2>
      <p>
        I absolutely <strong>love</strong> cooking and it's one of my favorite
        hobbies. There's just something
        <span class="dark-red">special</span> about being able to create
        something that brings people together. Perhaps that's why I enjoy being
        a software developer!
      </p>
      <p>
        This project was developed in <strong>Python</strong> and used
        <strong>Regular Expressions</strong> to scrape the web to find recipes
        based on the input ingredients. I decided to implement this program into
        my <strong style="color: #7289da">Discord Bot</strong> that I had been
        working on. I had a lot of fun working on this project because it was
        solving a problem that I could relate to!
      </p>
      <p>
        Often times, I have a certain set of ingredients available at home and
        would like to conjure up a dish based on those ingredients. Working on
        this project really put into perspective how programs, software, and
        technology have the ability to solve common, relatable, everyday
        problems.
